In an online community, new words come and go: today's \example{haha} may be replaced by tomorrow's \example{lol}. 
Changes in online writing are usually studied as a social process, with innovations diffusing through a network of individuals in a speech community.
But unlike other types of innovation, language change is shaped and constrained by the grammatical system in which it takes part.
To investigate the role of social and structural factors in language change, we undertake a large-scale analysis of the frequencies of nonstandard words in Reddit.
Dissemination across many linguistic contexts is a predictor of success: words that appear in more linguistic contexts grow faster and survive longer.
Furthermore, social dissemination plays a less important role in explaining word growth and decline than previously hypothesized.
