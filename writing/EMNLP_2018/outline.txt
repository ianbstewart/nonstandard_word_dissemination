- filtering spam users, non-English subs
- about 600 million comments, YYY tokens
- unique users and subreddits?
Methods
- computing frequency, user/subreddit percentages
- word embeddings (include wang2vec?)
- defining lexical niche and/or competition (combination of frequency and semantics)
Results
