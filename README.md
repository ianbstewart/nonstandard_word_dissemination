## Before starting

We assume that you have already collected the raw Reddit comments data from [here](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/) for 2013-06 through 2016-05. 
These files are each about 5 GB zipped, so make sure your server/computer has enough space before downloading.

The scripts have the following dependencies:
- Python
    - scipy
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - sklearn
    - statsmodels
    - nltk
    - lifelines
    - langid
    - stopwords
- R
    - relaimpo
    - causaldrf
    - survival
- notebook
    - jupyter-notebook
